# Sammy the Salmon
A 3D game about being a salmon who makes the incredible journey from the ocean back up to his spawning grounds.

Salmon can live in both freshwater and saltwater in their lifetime, making an arduous and epic journey from the ocean back up a river to their spawning grounds. 
The well-known and popular Sockeye Salmon are a silver color during their time in the ocean, and feed off of primarily zooplankton. Transforming into a vibrant red color when they swim and leap back to their spawning grounds, some Sockeye undertake the journey for over 900 miles.

As many fish are, Salmon are overfished, and sadly the majority of Salmon species on all continents are considered endangered.

This game is intended to be a fun, educational gaze into the life of the famously named leaping fish, the Salmon.
